# Security Policy

## Overview

Website Login Bot handles sensitive credentials and makes automated network requests. This document outlines the security measures implemented and best practices for users.

## Security Features

### Credential Storage

✅ **Keychain Integration**
- All credentials stored using macOS Keychain Services
- Encrypted by the operating system
- Protected by user's login password
- Never written to plain text files
- Never logged to disk

```swift
// Credentials are stored with kSecAttrAccessibleAfterFirstUnlock
// This provides a good balance of security and accessibility
```

### Network Security

✅ **HTTPS Enforcement** (Recommended)
- Application works with HTTPS URLs
- Certificate validation by URLSession
- TLS 1.2+ support

⚠️ **HTTP Not Recommended**
- Application will work with HTTP
- Credentials transmitted in plain text
- Vulnerable to man-in-the-middle attacks

### Code Security

✅ **No Credential Logging**
```swift
// Passwords never appear in logs
logMessage("Login attempt for user: \(username)") // OK
logMessage("Password: \(password)") // NEVER DONE
```

✅ **Input Sanitization**
- URL validation before requests
- Credential length limits
- No shell command injection (no shell commands used)

✅ **Hardened Runtime**
- Application built with hardened runtime enabled
- Prevents code injection attacks
- Library validation enabled

## Threat Model

### What We Protect Against

✅ **Credential Theft**
- Keychain encryption prevents disk access
- No credentials in UserDefaults
- No credentials in configuration files

✅ **Network Sniffing** (with HTTPS)
- TLS encryption for network traffic
- Certificate validation

✅ **Log File Exposure**
- Logs contain no credentials
- Logs stored in user directory (not world-readable)

### What We DON'T Protect Against

❌ **Malware on Your System**
- Keychain can be accessed by malware with your privileges
- Consider using a separate user account for sensitive automation

❌ **Physical Access**
- Anyone with physical access and your password can access Keychain
- Use FileVault for disk encryption

❌ **Website Security**
- Cannot protect against compromised target websites
- If the website is breached, your credentials may be exposed

❌ **Network-Level Attacks** (with HTTP)
- Plain HTTP exposes credentials to network observers
- Always use HTTPS

## Best Practices

### For Users

1. **Use HTTPS URLs Only**
   ```
   ✅ https://example.com/login
   ❌ http://example.com/login
   ```

2. **Use App-Specific Passwords**
   - Many sites offer API tokens or app passwords
   - Prefer these over your main account password
   - Limit scope to only what's needed

3. **Enable FileVault**
   ```bash
   # Check if FileVault is enabled
   sudo fdesetup status
   ```

4. **Review Permissions**
   - Only grant necessary permissions
   - Check System Preferences → Security & Privacy

5. **Monitor Logs**
   ```bash
   # Regularly check for suspicious activity
   tail -f ~/Library/Logs/WebsiteLoginBot/*.log
   ```

6. **Respect ToS**
   - Ensure target website allows automation
   - Review Terms of Service
   - Use reasonable request rates

7. **Secure Your Mac**
   - Keep macOS updated
   - Use a strong login password
   - Enable automatic updates
   - Use a firewall

### For Developers

1. **Never Log Credentials**
   ```swift
   // ❌ BAD
   print("Login with: \(username):\(password)")
   
   // ✅ GOOD
   print("Login attempt for user: \(username)")
   ```

2. **Validate All Inputs**
   ```swift
   guard let url = URL(string: urlString),
         url.scheme == "https" else {
       throw ValidationError.invalidURL
   }
   ```

3. **Use Secure Defaults**
   ```swift
   // Always use kSecAttrAccessible flags
   kSecAttrAccessible: kSecAttrAccessibleAfterFirstUnlock
   ```

4. **Minimize Permissions**
   - Request only necessary entitlements
   - No unnecessary network access
   - No unnecessary file system access

5. **Code Signing**
   ```bash
   # Sign the application
   codesign --force --deep --sign "Developer ID" app.app
   ```

## Vulnerability Disclosure

### Reporting Security Issues

**DO NOT** open public GitHub issues for security vulnerabilities.

Instead:
1. Email: [maintainer-email] (replace with actual email)
2. Include:
   - Description of the vulnerability
   - Steps to reproduce
   - Potential impact
   - Suggested fix (if any)

### Response Timeline

- **24 hours**: Initial acknowledgment
- **7 days**: Assessment and plan
- **30 days**: Fix and release (for critical issues)
- **90 days**: Public disclosure (coordinated)

### Security Updates

We will:
- Release patches for critical vulnerabilities ASAP
- Credit researchers (unless they prefer anonymity)
- Publish security advisories for significant issues

## Audit History

### Version 1.0 (2025-10-29)

- Initial security review
- Keychain integration verified
- Network security assessed
- Code signing implemented
- No known vulnerabilities

## Security Checklist

Before deployment:

- [ ] Credentials stored in Keychain only
- [ ] No credentials in logs
- [ ] HTTPS enforced for sensitive operations
- [ ] Code signed with valid certificate
- [ ] Hardened runtime enabled
- [ ] Input validation implemented
- [ ] Error messages don't leak sensitive data
- [ ] Dependencies are up to date
- [ ] No hardcoded secrets
- [ ] Proper file permissions set

## Known Limitations

1. **Keychain Access Control**
   - Any process running as the user can access Keychain items
   - Cannot prevent access from malware with user privileges
   - Mitigation: Run on a separate, restricted user account

2. **Network Monitoring**
   - Network traffic can be monitored at the system level
   - Mitigation: Use HTTPS, consider VPN

3. **Physical Access**
   - Physical access defeats most security measures
   - Mitigation: FileVault, strong passwords, auto-lock

4. **LaunchAgent Security**
   - LaunchAgent plists are user-writable
   - Could be modified to run malicious code
   - Mitigation: Monitor plist file modifications

## Compliance

### GDPR Considerations

If you're in the EU:
- Credentials are stored locally (not transmitted to us)
- No analytics or tracking
- No data shared with third parties
- You control your data completely

### Data Retention

- Credentials: Indefinite (until manually removed)
- Logs: Indefinite (manual cleanup required)
- Recommendation: Implement log rotation
